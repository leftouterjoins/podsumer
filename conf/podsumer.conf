# File Storage Method
#
# By default all data is stored in the database. If you would prefer
# to have your audio files and artwork stored on disk set this to
# `true` and specify a path where you would like podsumer to save
# files. If you have a very large libary this should improve the
# performance and size of backups.
#
# NOTE: If this value is changed after a library is already established,
# only _new_ items and feeds will use the new storage backend. Previously
# downloaded files will remain where they are.

# Make sure podsumer has permission to read and write in this directory.
# media_dir cannot be changed once library is established. If changed, some media
# files may no longer be servable.
